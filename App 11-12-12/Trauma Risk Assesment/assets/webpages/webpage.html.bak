		<p>Trauma Risk Management (TRiM) is a novel system of 
		post incident management which intend to allow commanders 
		to provide appropriate support to their subordinates in the 
		aftermath of traumatic events. Given the current very considerable 
		operational tempo being experienced by the majority of the UK Armed 
		Forces, it is perhaps not surprising that TRiM has been in use in both 
		Iraq and Afghanistan.<br> Although TRiM originated from within the Royal Marines, 
		it is now widely used in both the Royal Navy and Army; there are also plans to 
		introduce it into specific components of the Royal Air Force such as for the 
		RAF Regiment. This paper aims to explore the basis behind the TRiM system 
		and to explore the evidence for its growing popularity within hierarchical 
		organisations such as the military.<br><br>
